# Aviation Business Risk Analysis

## Overview
This project aims to analyze aviation accident data to provide actionable insights for business stakeholders. The primary goal is to identify the lowest-risk aircrafts for a company looking to expand into the aviation industry. The analysis involves data cleaning, imputation, and visualization to derive meaningful conclusions.

## Business Understanding

### Stakeholder
The stakeholder for this project is the head of the new aviation division at the company. This individual is responsible for making decisions regarding the purchase and operation of aircraft for both commercial and private enterprises.

### Key Business Questions
1. Which aircraft models have the lowest accident rates?
2. What is the impact of weather conditions on aviation accidents?
3. How do different makes and models of aircraft correlate with accident occurrences?

## Data Understanding and Analysis

### Source of Data
The data is sourced from the <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/khsamaha/aviation-accident-database-synopses/data" target="_blank">National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB)</a> and includes aviation accident data from 1962 to 2023. The dataset contains detailed information about civil aviation accidents and selected incidents in the United States and international waters.

### Description of Data
The dataset includes various attributes such as:
- Date and time of the accident
- Location (city and state)
- Aircraft make and model
- Weather conditions
- Injury severity
- Total fatal injuries
- And other relevant details

### Visualizations

## Conclusion

### Summary of Conclusions
Based on the comprehensive analysis of the aviation accident data, the following key findings were identified:

1. **Safer Aircraft Models**: Certain aircraft models were found to have significantly lower accident rates. These models are recommended for purchase to minimize risk.
   
2. **Impact of Weather Conditions**: Adverse weather conditions were shown to have a substantial correlation with the occurrence of accidents. Investing in advanced weather monitoring systems can mitigate these risks.
   
3. **Company Safety Records**: The analysis highlighted specific companies with exemplary safety records, indicating their adherence to strict safety protocols and maintenance practices.
